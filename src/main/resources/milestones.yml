# RandomWelcomeRewards milestones.yml File.

# Make milestones for players if they reach a certain number. All can be configurable and added on.



# To add a new reward for a certain amount, you need these conditions:
# 5: (the number of times the player has welcomed a new or returning player).
#   money: 100 (If you have vault, have money deposited to their account, if you don't want to use vault, this line can be removed).
#   commands:  (If you want to use commands, use the following example below, note that the only placeholder availble is "<player>", if you don't want to use commands, this line can be removed).
#     - "give <player> diamond 1"
#   message: (Type in a message here, you can use the "prefix" placeholder here, this just send a private message to the player, this line can also be removed if you don't want to use it).
# And that is it, you can add as many milestones as you want as long as you follow the example above.
