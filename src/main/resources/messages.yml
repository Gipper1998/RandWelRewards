# RandomWelcomeRewards Messages.yml File.

# Messages that can be configurable are right here, they can also be color coded using the "&" symbol.
# Messages can also be configurable using hex color codes by using "#" in the beginning. It will act like a solid gradient.
# An example for each configuration can be viewed here.
# For basic chat color codes, view here: https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php
# Note: The format used by "ยง" is replicated here using "&" for simplicity.
