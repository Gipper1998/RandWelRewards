# RandomWelcomeRewards
## Brief Description
RandomWelcomeRewards (or RandWelRewards for short) is a spigot plugin every server needs to allow players to welcome new (or returning) players with either funny,
strange, or weird messages. This plugin is based off of Ranulls "Welcome" plugin but with a lot of twists and extra features available, Whenever a player 
either types "welcome" or "wb," the plugin will generate a random message from the list in the "messages.yml" file and make it look like the player 
took the time and effort to write something nice (or bad) to the welcoming player. Each time they welcome a new or returning player, they can earn rewards 
like a diamond, in game currency, or being publicly humilated (the best part). If a player gains enough welcome points, they will get a milestone
everytime they hit a certain threshold configurable in the "milestones.yml" section. Players can keep count on their score through the stats command (see commands
section) and through leaderboards from either in chat or in a hologram (more on this later). Well, what are you waiting for. It's time for players to actually
start welcoming new players in a funnt way while also earning rewards along side it!!
## Plugin Information
### Server Version
The API is built off of 1.18, but should be able to go up towards 1.13 and beyond. If theres enough requests, I can upload a 1.12 and below version (more than likely up to
1.8). However, it will get limited updates and not much support from me since the native version of this plugin is 1.13 and beyond.
### Dependicies
No Dependices are required for this plugin, just drag and drop into the plugins folder and restart your server.
### Soft Dependicies
#### Vault
Vault can be used to give in-game currency and usually helps with most chat permission plugins. You can download the latest version of vault through here: 
https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault
#### PlaceholderAPI
PlaceholderAPI can be used to project the top welcoming points a player has or their current score on a hologram plugin 
(like HolographicDisplays, GHolos, DecentHolograms, etc..). You can find the latest version of PlaceholderAPI here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/
To use it, simply type in the following: %randwelrewards_(newwelcome_score or returnwelcome_score)_top_(newwelcome or returnwelcome)_(player or amount)_% 
It should return the score at which position specified.
